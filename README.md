# Requirements

- Docker Desktop
- NPM (version 8.19.2)

# To run

Open a terminal window in the root directory of the project and run:

- `docker compose build`
- `docker compose up`

Open a second terminal window in the root directory of the project and run:

- `cd frontend`
- `npm run start`

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in a web browser

# Next steps

- See if you can figure out how to connect the backend to the database! Think about how Docker networking works (hint: it makes it easier than you'd think)
- Make the UI pretty
  - Material UI
  - Ant Design
  - https://studio.patreon.com/ (I'm biased)
